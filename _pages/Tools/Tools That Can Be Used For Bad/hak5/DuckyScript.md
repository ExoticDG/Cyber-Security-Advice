WIth very simple and relatively cheap tools an entire network can be corrupted with malware. 

With something as simple as a Raspberry Pi Pico can hack an entire computer with something called “DuckyScript”.

This is an example of a setup I have made using this. 



That little device is able to hack my entire computer. In my opinion with all the security I have set up, my computer is a relatively hard thing to hack. 

Currently I have it setup to change my background though it can run any command on a device in a matter of seconds.

This technology can be put into any device that interfaces with a computer. Here is a company making all sorts of these things. (they are also the makers of DuckyScript)

This is an example of what a BADUSB device running ducky script can do. The BADUSB device is a FlipperZero and the output is from a USBvalve.
