***" Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and geeks in a toy-like body. It loves hacking digital stuff, such as radio protocols, access control systems, hardware, and more. It's fully open-source and customizable, so you can extend it in whatever way you like. "***[^fzone]

Along with that, the same hardware and software can be used **illegally** to hack into devices. 

As shown in both the DuckyScript and USValve pages this device can act as a BadUSB device, executing commands on a computer.
