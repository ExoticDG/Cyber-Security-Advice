[USBvalve](https://github.com/cecio/USBvalve) is a tool developed by a GitHub user known as [cecio](https://github.com/cecio).

It allows the detection of what a USB device is trying to do when plugging it into a device.

Some USB devices, commonly known as BadUSB might be trying to execute commands on the target device.

The below video is an example of what a BadUSB device can do. It is being detected by the USBvalve and then outputted to the computers terminal via serial.
