## Preventing Session Hijacking

Nothing can be entirety prevented on the internet.

However there are precautions to reduce the chances that this will happen to you.

A few tools I personally use are Vivaldi and VirusTotal. 

### Vivaldi

Vivaldi stands out as a highly customizable web browser designed for power users who prioritize privacy and control.

 Built on the Chromium engine, Vivaldi offers a familiar browsing experience while significantly enhancing it with a suite of built-in features that bolster security and user autonomy.   

Key Security and Privacy Features:

* **No Tracking:** Vivaldi is built on a philosophy of minimal data collection. The browser itself does not track user behavior, and it provides robust controls to limit third-party tracking.
   
* **Built-in Ad and Tracker Blocker:** Vivaldi includes a powerful ad and tracker blocker, helping to prevent invasive tracking scripts and malicious advertisements from compromising user privacy and security. Users can customize blocklists for granular control.

* **Built-in VPN:** Vivaldi by default includes a free version Proton VPN linked to your Vivaldi account, though it can be upgraded to a different/paid plan.
  
* **End-to-End Encrypted Sync:** Vivaldi Sync allows users to securely synchronize bookmarks, passwords, and other data across devices using end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the user can access their information. 
  
* **Privacy-Focused Features:** Vivaldi offers features like private windows, the ability to disable prefetching, and configurable cookie settings, empowering users to manage their online privacy.  
 
* **Regular Security Updates:** Being based on Chromium, Vivaldi benefits from regular security updates, patching vulnerabilities promptly to maintain a secure browsing environment.

* **Customizable Security Settings:** Vivaldi's extensive customization extends to security settings, allowing users to fine-tune their browsing experience to meet their specific security requirements.

In an era of increasing online surveillance and data breaches, Vivaldi provides a valuable alternative for users seeking greater control over their digital footprint. Its commitment to privacy, coupled with its robust security features, makes it a strong choice for individuals and organizations concerned about cybersecurity. The browser's focus on user customization allows for tailoring security settings to specific needs, enhancing protection against various online threats.   


### VirusTotal

VirusTotal is a free online service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojans, and other kinds of malicious software. 

It aggregates the results from numerous antivirus engines, website scanners, and file analysis tools, providing a comprehensive view of potential threats.   

Key Features and Importance:

* **Multi-Engine Scanning:** VirusTotal utilizes over 70 antivirus engines and website scanners, offering a broad perspective on potential threats that a single antivirus solution might miss. This greatly increases the probability of detecting malware.
   
* **URL Scanning:** It analyzes URLs for malicious content, including phishing websites, malware distribution sites, and other online threats. This helps users to avoid dangerous websites.   

* **File Analysis:** Users can upload files to VirusTotal for analysis, providing insights into whether a file is malicious. This is crucial for analyzing downloaded files and suspicious attachments.   

* **Community-Driven Intelligence:** VirusTotal benefits from a community of users who contribute to its database by submitting files and URLs for analysis. This collective intelligence helps to identify emerging threats quickly.
   
* **API for Integration:** VirusTotal offers an API that allows developers to integrate its scanning capabilities into their own applications and security tools. This is invaluable for automated malware analysis and threat intelligence.   

* **Detailed Reports:** VirusTotal provides detailed reports on scanned files and URLs, including information about detected threats, file metadata, and website information. This helps security professionals and researchers to understand the nature of potential threats.  

* **Passive DNS and Related Information:** VirusTotal also holds passive DNS information, and related file and URL information, that can give an analyst more context relating to a potential threat.   


VirusTotal is an essential tool for cybersecurity professionals, researchers, and everyday users. It provides a quick and reliable way to assess the safety of files and URLs, helping to prevent malware infections and other security incidents. Its multi-engine scanning and community-driven intelligence make it a powerful resource for identifying and analyzing emerging threats.
