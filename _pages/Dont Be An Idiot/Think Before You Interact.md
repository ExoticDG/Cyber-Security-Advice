***" More than 90% of successful cyber-attacks start with a phishing email.  A phishing scheme is when a link or webpage looks legitimate, but it’s a trick designed by bad actors to have you reveal your passwords, social security number, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information. Once they have that information, they can use it on legitimate sites. And they may try to get you to run malicious software, also known as malware.  If it’s a link you don’t recognize, trust your instincts, and think before you click. "***[^CSISA]

Attacks can occur almost instantly. Even if you think something is safe it could have malware behind the scenes that even the creators don't know about.

For example, one time when I was searching for different sheet music I came across a completely normal site, that when visited gave my computer a type of virus known as "Trogon". Luckily Windows Security almost instantly detected and quarantined it. The site installed malware almost instantly. Attacks happen very fast generally before you can react to them.
