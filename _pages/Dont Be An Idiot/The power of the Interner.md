The internet is a powerful place. If the wrong people find out certain things very bad things can happen.



I've noticed quite a few people publicly posting various information such as birthdays, now, feel free to do this, I however don't recommend doing so. 

Especially when under adult age (18+) and or if your apart of 'vulnerable' communities. (I personally am a LGBTQIA+ Furry. Part of the reason you likely wont see things linking to my identity on any of my internet posts. I follow my own advice.)

No Internet site is entirely secure, there are almost always ways to get in. 

It is possible if someone was devoted enough, they can hack into a channel account through various methods, find associated information such as email and phone number and then place various types of malware onto them. 

Viruses can be transported from computer to computer through Email, or through a website without your knowledge.

Once a person has a virus on a device such as a phone or computer they can trace through the accounts and data associated with that device to find out various information such as a name. 

With a combination of seemingly simple things such as a name and birthdate people can find out almost anything about a person through various resources that are available to the general public and some that are not.

Anything. SSN (Social Security Number), Bank account information, genetic information (it exists.), location, etc. 

If a channel gives out information such as their age and birthdate, once a hacker has even just their first name, they can trace a few possible options of who a person is if not find exactly who there are.

I personally do not care if you put this information out there though I advise against it.

Once a hacker has your identity, they can steal it, they can blackmail you, then can find your exact location and therefore find you, and much more. 

## Using the Internets Power to you're Advantage

Various illegal things happen all the time. 

Quite a few things happen when someone cant really get help. Weather there underage or some other factor.

This is when you can sometimes turn to the internet.

The same tools used by hackers can be used by white hackers or just general users with knowledge of the systems.

With the tools and just basic internet features users can find the people responsible for the crimes and either just strate up report them to the police or they can ruin there life. Or both.
